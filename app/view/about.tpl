		Chaplain Stories is a website created for history buffs that are particularly interested in the Chaplains that served during WWII.
		<br> <br>
		We were influenced by the famous story of The Four Chaplains. Their story starts and ends on February 3rd, 1943. Heroically, these four men worked to calm army soldiers aboard a ship under fire. The chaplains tended to the wounded, distributed lifejackets when it was apparent the ship was going under, and ultimately gave their lives in order to serve the greater purpose of the American Army. In the wake of World War II, the United States was  undergoing a change in religious culture. Specifically, the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt marked a pivotal point in United States religious history. It was during the years leading up to the war that the American culture started to become more accepting of Judaism and Catholicism, making America more of a tri-faith nation. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union address, references religious implications of World War II. With the culture in America becoming more open toward free exercise and tolerance of religion, Chaplains were sent to serve alongside soldiers in the war by providing moral support and guidance.
		<br> <br>
		This site is meant to commemorate these brave Chaplains from all countries and of all denominations so that their stories are never forgotten.
